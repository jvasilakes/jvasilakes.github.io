I am a first year PhD student at the [National Centre for Text Mining](http://nactem.ac.uk/) (NaCTeM) at the
University of Manchester advised by Prof Sophia Ananiadou. 

My broad research goal is to use NLP to improve access
to scientific knowledge by automatically extracting information from scientific texts. 
Specifically, I'm interested in how to properly account for modality (such as negation and uncertainty) when
extracting scientific claims. This interest extends into questions regarding knowledge representation and text generation as well.

See my [Research](/research/) page for more details.

Outside of the PhD, you might find me riding my gravel bike, baking sourdough bread, playing Dungeons & Dragons, and
trying to get good at [5D chess](https://www.5dchesswithmultiversetimetravel.com/).
