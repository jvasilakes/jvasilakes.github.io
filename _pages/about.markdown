I am a postdoc researcher in NLP at the University of Sheffield as part of the [GATE](https://gate.ac.uk/) team, where I am researching multi-lingual disinformation on social media.
In 2024 I obtained my PhD in NLP from the University of Manchester, where I was advised by Prof Sophia Ananiadou. 
Here I researched methods to incorporate modality into information extraction systems on scientific and clinical text.
